# Course_Scheduler

Implemented regression planner which creates a class schedule for Vanderbilt students. The scheduler outlines what courses a student has to take in order to reach the goal state from initial state. The goal state is the set of courses a student has to complete where as initial state is the set of courses, a student has already completed. Implemented hidden Markov Model to find the schedule availability for a given set of courses
